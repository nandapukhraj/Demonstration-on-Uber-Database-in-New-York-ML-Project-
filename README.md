# Demonstration-on-Uber-Database-in-New-York-ML-Project

This is a Machine Learning Project base on the Demonstration of Uber.

We have used the dataset of New York from April to September.

The data is used to individually represent each boroughs pick-up rate and drop-down destination.

There are 5 main boroughs taken into consideration i.e.

1. Brookyln

2. Queens

3. Manhattan

4. Bronx

5. Staten Island

Each of them is provided with a base code and are represented grapically.

At last we compare all of them to see the service rate in any of the boroughs to increase the development rate of Uber.
